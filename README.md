# Data Structures & Algorithms Lab Portfolio

This repository contains implementations and detailed visual analysis of fundamental computer science algorithms and data structures. The project demonstrates a deep understanding of sorting mechanics, graph theory, and data organisation techniques.

## 📖 Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to visualise and analyse the behaviour of key algorithms. It is divided into three main computational tasks:
1.  **Sorting Algorithms:** Comparative analysis of efficiency and mechanics.
2.  **Graph Theory:** Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
3.  **Data Structures:** Implementation of Hash Tables and Binary Search Trees (BST).

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
implementation and step-by-step visualisation of three distinct sorting methods:
* **Merge Sort:** A stable, Divide & Conquer algorithm ($O(n \log n)$).
* **Quick Sort:** An efficient in-place sorting algorithm using pivot partitioning.
* **Insertion Sort:** An iterative method efficient for small or nearly sorted datasets.

### 2. Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
* **Graph Topology:** Weighted graph construction based on unique identifier constraints.
* **Execution:** Step-by-step relaxation of edges using a Priority Queue approach to find the optimal path from Source ($A$) to Destination ($E$).
* **Outcome:** Successfully identified the critical shortest path ($A \to B \to D \to E$) with a total cost of **1**, significantly optimizing over the direct path cost of 8.

### 3. Data Structures
* **Hash Table:** Implementation using **Direct Addressing** with **Chaining** for collision resolution.
* **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Construction of a lexicographical tree, analysing insertion order and structural skewness caused by non-random input data.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts
* **Languages:** C++ / Python (Add whatever language you used for the logic, or just "Pseudocode/Flowchart Analysis")
* **Concepts:** Recursion, Divide & Conquer, Greedy Algorithms, Pointers, Linked Lists.
* **Tools:** Algorithm Visualisation, Flowchart Design.
